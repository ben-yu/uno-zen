		<p>A Browser-based multiplayer game using Three.js, Socket.io, and Node.js</p>
		<p>Entirely built using Coffeescript for that much needed syntatic sugar and readability. Using Backbone for the frontend framework simplified syncing with the backend, and a bunch of other things like event binding etc... I could also share the same models and collections with the Node backend.</p>
		<p>Brunch provided an amazing build pipeline, automatically compiling and optimizing the entire application for deployment. Socket.io provided realtime communication with the backend via HTML5 Websockets.</p>
		<p>A work in progress... Code can be found <a href="https://github.com/ben-yu/space-bees">here</a></p>
