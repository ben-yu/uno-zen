		<p>E-mail is the core of business communication, yet it still remains a passive form of communication. It is still paper mail, just in electronic form. Forward is a reimagining of e-mail, brining a suite of communication tools to improve and enhance e-mail as a core business communication tool.</p>
		<p>We developed an initial prototype using Ember.js with Node.js backend to handle e-mail and metadata.</p>
